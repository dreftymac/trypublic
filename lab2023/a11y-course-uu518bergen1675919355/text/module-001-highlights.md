## Overview
* a11y is about people, not checklists

### Item: 1.2.4 Accessibility of life and death information

* Dr. John Slatin was an English professor at University of Texas
* In 2005, John was diagnosed with leukemia. He needed to research life-and-death decisions on treatment options. But John found that many of the websites that provide such information on treatments were not accessible.

### Item: 1.2.6 More people (who don't use screen readers)

* Some disabilities are “invisible” or “hidden”; that is, you can’t tell by looking at someone that they have that impairment
* It is likely that some people you know have disabilities that you aren’t aware of.

### Item: 1.3.5 Benefits to others

* While accessible media is essential for people with disabilities, it is also very useful for everyone in a variety of situations.
    * Skimmed or read quickly rather than watched or listened to.
    * Used without needing to download video files. For example, to save data on mobile.
    * Used offline, printed, or converted to braille.
