## Query: what are the diffs b/t english and chinese pronunciation
<!--- id="dmid://uu359sledship1679802417xhmd" --->

English and Chinese pronunciation are quite different, and there are several key differences between the two languages:

* Phonemes: English has approximately 44 phonemes (distinct sounds), while Mandarin Chinese has around 400. This means that Chinese has a much larger inventory of sounds, which can make it more challenging for English speakers to learn.

* Tones: Mandarin Chinese is a tonal language, meaning that the meaning of a word can change depending on the tone in which it is pronounced. Mandarin has four main tones, plus a neutral tone, while some dialects have up to nine tones. English, on the other hand, is not tonal, so the meaning of a word is not affected by the pitch or tone of its pronunciation.

* Consonant and vowel sounds: English and Mandarin have different sets of consonant and vowel sounds, and some sounds that are common in English, such as "th" and "v", do not exist in Mandarin. Additionally, Mandarin has a number of vowel sounds that are not present in English.

* Stress and rhythm: English has a stress-timed rhythm, meaning that stressed syllables are pronounced with a regular beat, while unstressed syllables are pronounced more quickly and with less emphasis. Mandarin, on the other hand, has a syllable-timed rhythm, meaning that each syllable is pronounced with roughly equal emphasis and duration.

Overall, the differences in pronunciation between English and Mandarin can make it challenging for speakers of one language to learn the other. However, with practice and study, it is possible to improve one's pronunciation in both languages.
